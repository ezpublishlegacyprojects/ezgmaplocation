CHANGELOG

Version 1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* code cleanup
* bigger map in edit view and normal view
* button to grab current location
* PHPDoc inline documentation added where applicable
* Address is now stored
* Datatype can now be used as a name pattern component (address)
* Datatype is now searchable (by address)
* Store data in external table to be able to filter on it
* Datatype is now sortable (by address)
* Added Extended attribute filter to fetch list / tree by cordinates and distance


Version 0.5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* only compatible with eZ Publish 4

Version 0.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Resolved a few warnings and error messages.

* Much simpler install - modified the javascript so that no template changes
  are required in the admin design.

* The editing controls will now work properly if there are multiple location
  attributes on a single object.

* In the editing view, the map will now re-center on the clicked point. This
  makes it easier to use the click-point and zoome controls to hone in on a
  specific point.

* The edit map now defaults to a zoom-level-0 view of the globe instead of
  a gray square.

* The edit map is larger, so that the map type and directional controls don't
  overlap.

* A new template has been included, gmap.tpl. This is a multi-purpose template
  that can be included and configured to handle several common use-cases for
  the gmaps datatype. See the doc on the template for specifics.

Version 0.3 - Initial Release
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
